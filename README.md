# Automated_production_chain
This project showcases an automated production line developed using TIA Portal, Siemens PLCSIM, and Factory IO, capable of producing three different types of products. The system runs on a virtual PLC using PLCSIM, allowing full simulation without physical hardware. An integrated HMI interface enables the user to select the product type, define production quantities, and monitor system status in real time. The 3D simulation in Factory IO includes conveyors, sensors, and actuators to process and automatically sort products by type. This setup demonstrates key Industry 4.0 principles such as flexibility, virtualization, user-driven control, and intelligent sorting—offering a complete, scalable, and hardware-independent manufacturing solution.
